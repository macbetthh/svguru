## Video Walkthroughs
*Apologies for splitting into 3, I used OBS and forgot to change to a display capture instead of window capture. Also, smaller file sizes ;)*

## Shape Classes
This project includes classes for different shapes (Circle*, Triangle*, Square*, Rectangle, Ellipse, Star, Heart). 
Each class has a render method that returns a string representing the SVG element for the shape.

**Required shapes - other shapes added to challenge myselfüòá*
