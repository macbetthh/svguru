## Video Walkthroughs
*Apologies for splitting into 3, I used OBS and forgot to change to a display capture instead of window capture. Also, smaller file sizes ;)*

- **Pro Tip**: I use the `SVG Preview` Extension on VS Code to see my SVG files immediately -- I recommend using it or one like it if you'd rather see it directly in the editor instead of in a browser or by opening another program! :)

## Shape Classes
This project includes classes for different shapes (Circle*, Triangle*, Square*, Rectangle, Ellipse, Star, Heart). 
Each class has a render method that returns a string representing the SVG element for the shape.

**Required shapes - other shapes added to challenge myself😇*
